# ethOS App directory

This is a web app designed to be used while a DAppStore is in development.

Any developer can make a Pull-Request and add their app in the file `src/apps_dir.json`. In this app directory, every app has a `name`, a `description`, an `image_url`, and an `apk_url`. There are examples located in the file `src/apps_dir_example.json`.

This website will be continuously deployed after each PR is merged.
